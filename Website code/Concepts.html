        <!-- Concept 1: Service Workers -->
        <section class="concept-card">
            <h2>1. Service Workers</h2>
            <p>
                Service workers are the technological foundation that enables PWAs to function offline and provide 
                a native app-like experience. They act as a programmable network proxy, sitting between your web 
                application and the network.
            </p>
            
            <h3>How Service Workers Work</h3>
            <p>
                A service worker runs in a separate thread from the main browser thread, meaning it doesn't have 
                access to the DOM but can intercept and handle network requests, manage cache storage, and handle 
                background sync operations. This separation allows the service worker to run independently, even 
                when the web page is closed.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Capabilities</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Intercept and modify network requests and responses</li>
                <li>Cache resources for offline access</li>
                <li>Enable background synchronization</li>
                <li>Handle push notifications</li>
                <li>Perform periodic background updates</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Security Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Service workers can only be registered on pages served over HTTPS (or localhost for development). 
                This ensures that the service worker cannot be tampered with during transit and protects users 
                from man-in-the-middle attacks.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Concept 2: Cache API -->
        <section class="concept-card">
            <h2>2. Cache API</h2>
            <p>
                The Cache API provides a storage mechanism for Request/Response object pairs that are cached in 
                long-lived memory. It's specifically designed for service workers but can also be accessed from 
                the main thread.
            </p>

            <h3>Cache Storage Organization</h3>
            <p>
                Caches are organized into named Cache objects that you can create and manage. Each cache can 
                store multiple request-response pairs, allowing you to organize your cached resources logically 
                (e.g., "app-shell-v1", "images-v1", "api-cache-v2").
            </p>

            <h3>Common Cache Operations</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>cache.put():</strong> Stores a request-response pair</li>
                <li><strong>cache.add():</strong> Fetches and stores a resource</li>
                <li><strong>cache.match():</strong> Retrieves a cached response</li>
                <li><strong>cache.delete():</strong> Removes a cached item</li>
                <li><strong>caches.open():</strong> Opens or creates a named cache</li>
                <li><strong>caches.delete():</strong> Deletes an entire named cache</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cache Management Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                Effective cache management involves setting appropriate cache sizes, implementing cache versioning, 
                and cleaning up old caches when deploying updates. This prevents unlimited cache growth and ensures 
                users get the latest version of your application.
            </p>

        <!-- Concept 3: Web App Manifest -->
        <section class="concept-card">
            <h2>3. Web App Manifest</h2>
            <p>
                The web app manifest is a JSON file that provides metadata about your web application. It enables 
                the "Add to Home Screen" functionality and controls how your PWA appears and behaves when installed 
                on a user's device.
            </p>

            <h3>Essential Manifest Properties</h3>
            <p>
                The manifest includes properties like the app name, icons in various sizes, start URL, display 
                mode, theme colors, and orientation preferences. These properties ensure your PWA provides a 
                consistent, native-like experience across different devices and platforms.
            </p>

            <h3>Display Modes</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>fullscreen:</strong> Opens in fullscreen, hiding all browser UI</li>
                <li><strong>standalone:</strong> Opens in a standalone window, looks like a native app</li>
                <li><strong>minimal-ui:</strong> Shows minimal browser UI (back button, reload)</li>
                <li><strong>browser:</strong> Opens in a regular browser tab</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Icons and Visual Identity</h3>
            <p>
                Your manifest should include icons in multiple sizes (typically 192x192 and 512x512 pixels) to 
                ensure sharp display on different devices and contexts. The theme_color property defines the 
                toolbar color and affects the app's appearance in the task switcher.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Concept 4: Progressive Enhancement -->
        <section class="concept-card">
            <h2>4. Progressive Enhancement</h2>
            <p>
                Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that ensures your PWA works for all users, 
                regardless of their browser capabilities, while progressively adding advanced features for 
                browsers that support them.
            </p>

            <h3>Core Functionality First</h3>
            <p>
                The foundation of progressive enhancement is building core functionality using basic web 
                technologies that work everywhere. This base layer should provide essential features using 
                standard HTML and CSS, ensuring accessibility for all users.
            </p>

            <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
            <p>
                Rather than assuming browser support, PWAs should use feature detection to determine what 
                capabilities are available. This allows you to conditionally enable features like service 
                workers, push notifications, or offline functionality only when supported.
            </p>

            <h3>Graceful Degradation</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Provide fallbacks for unsupported features</li>
                <li>Ensure content is accessible without JavaScript</li>
                <li>Maintain functionality on older browsers</li>
                <li>Test across multiple browsers and devices</li>
                <li>Use polyfills strategically for critical features</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Concept 5: Responsive Design -->
        <section class="concept-card">
            <h2>5. Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>
                Responsive design ensures your PWA adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, orientations, 
                and input methods. This is crucial since PWAs run on everything from smartphones to desktop 
                computers.
            </p>

            <h3>Fluid Layouts</h3>
            <p>
                Use relative units (percentages, em, rem, vw, vh) instead of fixed pixel values to create 
                layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful tools for 
                building flexible, responsive layouts.
            </p>

            <h3>Mobile-First Approach</h3>
            <p>
                Start by designing for mobile devices, then progressively enhance the experience for larger 
                screens. This ensures your PWA works well on resource-constrained devices and slower networks, 
                where optimization matters most.
            </p>

            <h3>Media Queries and Breakpoints</h3>
            <p>
                Use CSS media queries to apply different styles based on screen size, resolution, and 
                orientation. Common breakpoints target phones (up to 768px), tablets (768px-1024px), and 
                desktops (1024px and above), but should be tailored to your content's needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Touch and Mouse Support</h3>
            <p>
                Design interactive elements that work well with both touch and mouse input. Ensure buttons 
                and links are large enough for touch targets (minimum 44x44 pixels) and provide appropriate 
                hover states for mouse users.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Concept 6: HTTPS and Security -->
        <section class="concept-card">
            <h2>6. HTTPS and Security</h2>
            <p>
                HTTPS is not optional for PWAs—it's a fundamental requirement. Service workers can only be 
                registered on secure origins, ensuring that your PWA's code cannot be tampered with in transit.
            </p>

            <h3>Why HTTPS Matters</h3>
            <p>
                HTTPS encrypts all communication between the user's browser and your server, preventing 
                attackers from intercepting sensitive data or injecting malicious code. This protection is 
                especially critical for PWAs because service workers have powerful capabilities like 
                intercepting all network requests.
            </p>

            <h3>Content Security Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to provide an additional layer of security. CSP 
                helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources of content are 
                trusted and can be loaded by your PWA.
            </p>

            <h3>Secure Storage</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li>Use IndexedDB or Cache API for client-side storage</li>
                <li>Never store sensitive data like passwords in local storage</li>
                <li>Implement proper authentication mechanisms</li>
                <li>Use secure, httpOnly cookies for session management</li>
                <li>Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Concept 7: App Shell Model -->
        <section class="concept-card">
            <h2>7. App Shell Model</h2>
            <p>
                The app shell model is an architectural approach that separates your PWA's core application 
                infrastructure from its content. The shell is the minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed 
                to power the user interface, which loads instantly from the cache.
            </p>

            <h3>Benefits of App Shell Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                By caching the app shell separately from dynamic content, your PWA can provide instant loading 
                and immediate responsiveness, even on slow or unreliable networks. The UI framework loads 
                immediately from the cache, while content loads dynamically.
            </p>

            <h3>Shell Components</h3>
            <ul class="content-list">
                <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Header, menu, and navigation elements</li>
                <li><strong>Layout structure:</strong> Page containers and layout grids</li>
                <li><strong>Core styles:</strong> Essential CSS for the UI framework</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript framework:</strong> Client-side routing and core functionality</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementation Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                During the service worker installation phase, cache all app shell resources. On subsequent 
                visits, serve the shell from the cache immediately while fetching dynamic content from the 
                network. This approach provides the speed of a cached experience with the freshness of 
                dynamic content.
            </p>

            <h3>Separating Shell from Content</h3>
            <p>
                Keep your app shell lean by only including resources necessary for the basic UI. Load 
                page-specific content and features dynamically as needed. This separation reduces the 
                initial payload and ensures fast, reliable loading of the core experience.
            </p>
